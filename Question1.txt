Though there are many flaws and objections I carry concerning the academic policy, 
namely those which are finds itself quickly outdated, unable to adjust for the ever changing, 
dynamic environment and culture in which plagrism is made easier,
it is implied that all students and teachers attending the college adhere to the policy whether they are aware or not, whether they like it or not.

I've no choice but to accept.
